### PROPOSED MODEL ðŸ§©

**Detailed Explanation:**
This section details the proposed approach for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries using machine learning models. The study implements six different machine learning models: Deep Neural Network (DNN), Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), NaÃ¯ve Bayes, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Kernel PCA. These models are trained on early-cycle data to predict battery life and their performances are compared to identify the most effective model.

The steps involved in the proposed model are:
1. **Raw Data Collection**: Data from lithium-ion phosphate (LFP) or graphite cells is collected using an intelligent Battery Management System (BMS).
2. **Data Pre-Processing**: The dataset is cleaned, processed, and any missing values are filled.
3. **Normalization**: Standard Scaler function is applied to standardize the dataset, reducing data redundancy and improving integrity.
4. **Splitting the Data**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets in a 75:25 ratio.
5. **Training the Models**: Each machine learning model is trained on the training set.
6. **Evaluating the Models**: The performance of each model is evaluated on the testing set.

The study found that the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and PCA models performed the best, showing high accuracy in predicting the battery's remaining useful life.

**Layman Explanation:**
This part of the paper explains the step-by-step process they used to predict how long lithium-ion batteries will last. They tried six different computer models to see which one could best predict battery life using data from the first 100 cycles. Here's how they did it:

1. **Collecting Data**: They gathered data from the batteries as they were being used.
2. **Cleaning Data**: They made sure the data was accurate and filled in any missing pieces.
3. **Standardizing Data**: They adjusted the data so it was on a similar scale, making it easier to work with.
4. **Splitting Data**: They divided the data into two parts: one for training the models and one for testing them.
5. **Training**: They taught each model using the training data.
6. **Testing**: They checked how well each model could predict battery life using the testing data.

They discovered that some models were better than others, with the Deep Neural Network and PCA models being the top performers.

**Importance:**
1. **Systematic Approach**: Following a structured process ensures that the models are trained and evaluated consistently.
2. **Data Preparation**: Proper data pre-processing and normalization are crucial for improving model performance.
3. **Model Comparison**: Comparing multiple models helps in identifying the best approach for the specific problem.

**Context Related to Overall Goal:**
The proposed model section is central to achieving the study's goal of accurately predicting the remaining useful life of lithium-ion batteries. By following a rigorous approach to data collection, pre-processing, and model training, the study aims to find the most effective method for making these predictions.

**Math Intuition and ML Terminologies:**
- **Standard Scaler**: A technique to standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.
- **Training Set**: The portion of the data used to train the machine learning models.
- **Testing Set**: The portion of the data used to evaluate the performance of the trained models.
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**: A type of artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers.
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.

The proposed model section outlines the comprehensive methodology used to predict battery life, highlighting the importance of each step in ensuring accurate and reliable predictions. ðŸ“ŠðŸ”‹ðŸ§
