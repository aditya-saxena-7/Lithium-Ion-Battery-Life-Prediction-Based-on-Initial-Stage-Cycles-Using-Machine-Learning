### Abstract ðŸ“œ

The abstract of the paper summarizes the research on predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries. It highlights the critical role of accurate RUL prediction in enhancing intelligent battery management systems (BMS). The paper introduces several integrated machine learning models specifically designed to predict the RUL during the first 100 life cycles of the battery. These models were trained using early-stage data, and their performance was compared to identify the most effective one. The results demonstrated that the proposed approach performs better than existing methods in terms of accuracy. The study concludes that machine learning can significantly improve the prediction of the battery life cycle.

**Importance:**
Accurate RUL prediction is essential for several reasons:
1. **Battery Management**: Enhances the efficiency and reliability of battery management systems, leading to better performance and longer battery life.
2. **Safety**: Helps in preventing unexpected battery failures, which can be crucial for applications like electric vehicles and portable electronics.
3. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduces maintenance costs by predicting when a battery needs to be replaced, avoiding unnecessary replacements.
